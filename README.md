Fake vs Real News Classifier

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is deployed as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.

Deployment
Live App on Streamlit Cloud:
https://news-classifier-app-f9nwugmadbpgjw6rk7dk4d.streamlit.app/

Project Overview
With the rise of misinformation on the internet, particularly through social media platforms, identifying fake news has become a critical challenge. This project develops a scalable, intelligent NLP-based classifier to detect whether a news article is genuine or fraudulent.

Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world news data from Kaggle
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Logistic Regression (92% Accuracy)
- Evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix
- Streamlit-based Web UI for interactive predictions
- Real-time prediction with confidence scores

Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, Joblib
Text Processing: NLTK (stopword removal, tokenization)
Vectorization: TF-IDF (Top 5000 features)
ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud, GitHub
Visualization: Matplotlib (local)
Dataset Source: Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset

Project Structure
- app.py: Streamlit App Script
- model.pkl: Trained Logistic Regression Model
- tfidf_vectorizer.pkl: Saved TF-IDF Vectorizer
- requirements.txt: Required Python libraries
- README.md: Project Overview (this file)
- data/
    - True.csv: Real news dataset
    - Fake.csv: Fake news dataset

Model Development Workflow
1. Data Collection: Combined True.csv and Fake.csv, added binary labels (1 = Real, 0 = Fake).
2. Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation & stopword removal using NLTK.
3. Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization, limited to 5000 top features.
4. Modeling: Trained and compared Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
5. Evaluation: Measured with Accuracy (~92%), F1-score, and confusion matrix.
6. Web UI: Developed Streamlit frontend for clean and responsive predictions.
7. Deployment: Hosted via GitHub and Streamlit Cloud.
